This is a small prototype started at HackRU 2014.  It plans to implement at least 1 variation of the classic 4 player game Mahjong.  Local bluetooth multiplayer is part of its plans along with customizable options for different variations.

Update: 4/13/2014
Game is unable to display graphics of any kind.  Solutions include other engines and just continue trying to debug the problem.
